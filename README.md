# Nuero-Cyc

I came across an [obituary in The Economist for Douglas Lenat]([url](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2023/09/13/douglas-lenat-trained-computers-to-think-the-old-fashioned-way)), with whom I was unfamiliar at the time. This lead me to look up Cyc and from there learn about the discontinued project OpenCyc. Inspired by the moment, I wanted to see if I could wrap it in an LLM and get it to do anything interesting. In its current state, this project is not very polished, I may or may not tinker with it more at some point.
